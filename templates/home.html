    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I think that if you are reading this, there is already a video up there in which I talk about myself, but here we go:
    </p>
    <p>
        My name is Ewerton. I have 25 years old and I live in Brazil. My favorite hobby is to learn new things. I like to code, especially with Python, but I can make some <em>Hello Worlds</em> in C++, Java, Javascript, C, MATLAB, R... It's mostly the same. I don't like front-end and I spent almost a year trying to force myself to make this page.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started to code when I was in college doing my Chemical Engineering classes. I had to spend two semesters learning MATLAB, and I think it is the last language I would use for anything, so... don't learn it, Python is better.
    </p>
    <p>
        A little after that, I created my own company in which I started to translate things from English, French, and Spanish to Portuguese. With the awesome help of Python, I created a scraper to get developers and companies' emails from Play Store and sent them my flyer - Oh, by the way, I'm good with Photoshop, it's an awesome tool that everyone should learn!
    </p>
    <p>
        The business grew, I had a bunch of contracts, got some money, but translate games is not something that I wanted to keep doing. It's repetitive and after a while, you aren't learning anything, so I stopped. But if you want some details, I translated about 160,000 words! For comparison, the New Testament has 184,600, ha.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>"I did not know you'd give me so quickly. Thank you very much!" - <em>Quick Turtle</em></li>
        <li>"Thank you, Ewerton! It's really nice to work with you!" - <em>Ray Spark</em></li>
        <li>"Thanks for the quick work!" - <em>Scott Goffman</em></li>
        <li>"I appreciated your previous work translating Tallowmere 2!" - <em>Chris McFarland</em></li>
        <li>"Wow, you are really fast, thank you!" - <em>Spotadvisor</em></li>
        <li>"Hello Ewerton, thanks that was fast! It's perfect!" - <em>GuyCorp Games</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I got a job as a Data Analyst from a company called BeGrowth. I had to extract reports from our ads that were running in Google and Facebook Ads, then merge them with some other reports to finally show the results to my boss so he could change whatever needed to be changed. It was a cumbersome task to manually merge those files every day, so I created a Python script that did everything in 3 minutes - 57 minutes less, yay.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started to help my boss manage those same ads. It was a nice experience, I could grasp some concepts in Marketing, Google Tag Manager, Analytics, and some other tools, and helped them grow 10 times what they were investing in just 6 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, I was promoted to a Data Engineer. My first task was to make my script run on Cloud. I used a VM in GCP, running a Docker container that had an Airflow image, basically. I created scripts that, every hour, collected reports from Facebook, Google Ads, Google Ad Manager and Google Analytics, then moved them to partitioned tables inside Big Query - we used it as our Datalake and Datawarehouse. With the data gathered and stored, I started to make dashboards using Google Data Studio, but tried Power BI, as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        In June, 2021, I started working for BlueShift. I'm in a team of 20 Data Engineers trying to learn everything that I didn't use till now. As you can see, I'm definitely a Junior, but I'm an awesome dude that looks forward to the future.
